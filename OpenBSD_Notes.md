## Set static DNS to Quad9
Disabling resolvd is necessary as mentioned in the reference otherwise it will keep re-writing our changes.

```
rcctl stop resolvd
```

Edit the resolv.conf file and put custom DNS

```
vi /etc/resolv.conf
```

Contents:
```
nameserver 9.9.9.9
nameserver 149.112.112.112
```

Test DNS:
```
nslookup www.google.com
```
